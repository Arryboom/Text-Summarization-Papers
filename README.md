# Text-Summarization-Papers



An exhaustive paper list for **Text Summarization**,
covering papers from eight top conferences (*ACL / EMNLP / NAACL / ICML / ICLR / AAAI / IJCAI / NIPS*)  and eight years (*2013-2020*).  




## What can I get here?



### 1. What are the recent Research Concepts and which are HOT?

#### [`Concepts Definition`](https://github.com/neulab/Text-Summarization-Papers/blob/master/summ_concept.md)
We define typology of important concepts that you should know for Summarization task.
We detail them [here](XX).


#### `Statistics of Highlighted Concepts`
<img src="fig/stat_summ-1.png" alt="Summary" height="500" width="1200">


<img src="fig/blue.png" alt="before 2019" height="20" width="20"> denotes the number of papers before 2019
<br>


<img src="fig/red.png" alt="from 2019" height="20" width="20"> denotes the number of papers from 2019
<br>


#### Trends:
<img src="fig/fire.png" alt="HOT" height="20" width="20"> Concepts in red suggest HOT topics, and we can observe:


* **Task**: scientific paper-based summarization has gain growing interests.
* **Data**: More new datasets are constructed
* **Architecture**: Pretrained models and graph neural networks prevail
* **Evaluation**: evaluation of generated summary's factuality attracts recent attention




### 2. Recommended Papers

#### Papers with Hot Topics
* [`pre-X`](XX): summarizer with unsupervised pretrained models
* [`task-sci`](): scientifc paper-based summarization
* [`eval-factuality`](): factuality evaluation on generated summaries.
* [`arch-transformer`](): summarization system consists of Transformer.
* [`arch-gnn`](): graph neural network-based summarizers. 
* [`data-new`](): more new datasets are constructed



#### Milestone Papers

### 4. Mainstream [Dataset List &#x1F53D;](http://pfliu.com/pl-summarization/summ_data.html)






## What can I do here?
* ### If you have a new "research concept"?  -- Tell us
	* **Update** the file [`summ_concept.md`](https://github.com/neulab/Text-Summarization-Papers/blob/master/summ_concept.md) and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose an `Issues`


* ### If you have a new "paper" or more reasonable annotations?
	* **Add** your paper (If possible, with annotated concepts) into [`paper_with_concept`](https://github.com/neulab/Text-Summarization-Papers/blob/master/summ_concept.md) and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose an `Issues`


* ### If you have a new "dataset"?
	* **Add** your dataset (If possible, with brief description) into [`ner_data`](https://github.com/neulab/Text-Summarization-Papers/blob/master/summ_concept.md) and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose an `Issues`



## Future Work
Hopefully, you will see version2.0 covering papers from 1980 to 2020.
